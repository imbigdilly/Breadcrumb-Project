This tricks the game into thinking it is running on Steam. It's already installed by default, but it might break.<br>
If this happens, download the zip, extract, and copy "steam_api.dll" into the "bin" folder. If asked to replace, say yes.<br>

Download 7zip and install 7zip, and open the zip file using it.<br>

TF2 classic launcher: https://github.com/tf2classic/tf2c-launcher/releases/download/v1.5/TF2ClassicLauncher.exe<br>
Next, download the launcher, and place it in the game folder (where hl2.exe is found). Run it to update and play.<br>

To change your name, go the "bin" folder. Create a new folder called "steam_settings", then a textfile called "force_account_name". In this file enter<br>
the name you want.

If the launcher  doesn't work, try the steps below.<br>

Extract to your folder, and then right click on hl2.exe<br>
Here, click on "show more options", then create a shortcut.<br>
Do the same for the new shortcut, but go onto the properties. You'll see a new window popup, find the target box.<br>
It should have the file directory. Go to the end of the target and add "-game tf2classic", making sure there's a space ibetween.<br>
Click on your new shortcut, and the game will launch.
