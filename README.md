Ignore this, unless the game breaks.<br>
This tricks the game into thinking it is running on Steam. It's already installed by default, but it might break.<br>
If this happens, download the zip, extract, and copy "steam_api.dll" into the "bin" folder. If asked to replace, say yes.<br>

To **change your name**, go the "bin" folder. Create a new folder called "steam_settings", then a textfile called "force_account_name". In this file enter the name you want.<br>

If the launcher  doesn't work, try the steps below.<br>

Extract to your folder, and then right click on hl2.exe<br>
Here, click on "show more options", then create a shortcut.<br>
Do the same for the new shortcut, but go onto the properties. You'll see a new window popup, find the target box.<br>
It should have the file directory. Go to the end of the target and add "-game tf2classic", making sure there's a space inbetween.<br>
Click on your new shortcut, and the game will launch.
