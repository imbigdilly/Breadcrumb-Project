## TF2 RELATED<br>
If the launcher  doesn't work, try the steps below.<br>

Extract to your folder, and then right click on hl2.exe<br>
Here, click on "show more options", then create a shortcut.<br>
Do the same for the new shortcut, but go onto the properties. You'll see a new window popup, find the target box.<br>
It should have the file directory. Go to the end of the target and add "-game tf2classic", making sure there's a space inbetween.<br>
Click on your new shortcut, and the game will launch.
