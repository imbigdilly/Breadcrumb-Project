## TF2 RELATED<br>
Team Fortress 2: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jv9oNnS1ghgmzioT7DNPHmpTSoFCHgxL/view?usp=sharing<br>
Extract and run Team Fortress 2.exe. Press the WindowsKey+R. (Windows Key is the one with three squares, on the bottom left of your keyboard.)<br>

Type %appdata% and click Okay. An explorer window will appear. Near the top of the window it will say most likely say "(your username) > AppData > Roaming". (your username is your account name)<br>

Click on this line. It will then probably change to "C:\Users\(yourUsername)\AppData\Roaming" Remove the "\AppData\Roaming" bit. Next, right click and create a new folder, name it "Other". Open the new folder and go back to the Team Fortress 2.exe window.<br>

Copy the file path from your "Other" folder into the "Destination Folder" bit. Press extract, and wait for it to finish. Once it's done, a new folder will appear.<br>

The game is now installed, and can be opened with "tf.exe". To make opening the game easier, find "tf.exe", right click, press "Show More Options", and then create a shortcut ("tf.exe - Shortcut"). Drag this shortcut to your desktop. We are not finished yet though, as we need to install "autoexec.cfg".<br>


Autoexec.cfg: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hqRG4tVEYVXkM4gV5tiUdaiRFXD7DxZf/view?usp=sharing<br>
This is a script that changes the default settings. Some changes include increasing FOV, enabling LAN and optimising perfomance. Download the file, then go to your Team Fortress 2 folder. Click on the "tf" folder, then "cfg". Drag autoexec.cfg here. The script will now run everytime you play the game.<br>

There are also some other settings you should change yourself. First, go onto "Options" and click "advanced". Enable the developer console, and fast weapon switch if not already enabled.<br>

Your mouse settings can be changed on the Mouse tab. You can adjust your sensitivity if you don't like the default. To change the size of the game or make it full screen, go the Video tab. You can also adjust graphics settings via "Advanced".<br>#

Finally, go to the multiplayer tab. You can adjust your crosshair, I recommend "crosshair 3", at a large size, with the colour purple.<br>

Most importanly though, is that you go on "Advanced" in the multiplayer tab. Disable "minimal hud" if it is on.<br>

Turn on "Medigun continues healing", "Sniper Rifle will rezoom", "automatically reload", "display damage done", "MEDIC: Display a marker", "MEDIC: Injured teammates call out", and "Play a hitsound when you injure an enemy."<br>

It's highly recommended you turn these on. Your name can be changed at the bottom of the advanced multiplayer settings page.<br>

To create a server, next to "Start Playing" will be two icons. A target icon, reading "Offline Practice", and a plus icon, reading "Create a server." Offline practice is for matches with both bots and LAN play, and create a server is for real players only.<br>
Offline practice has less maps than create a server, but having bots is more fun.<br>

Once a server is created, you may need to enable "sv_lan 1". This should not be needed, but just in case press the "`" key (under esc key), and type that command in.<br>

To find a server, click on "Start Playing", and then LAN. Double click on the server to join.<br>
If a server has been made but you can't see it, you might have to connect manually. Have the server host press "`" (under esc key), then "status". Find the server ip in the text that appears in the console. Go to your computer and press the same key they did. (under esc key) Type "connect (ip address)", and replace (ip address) with the one the host had. Make sure you have :27015 at the end, or whatever the host had on their IP address. Once you've checked it matches, press submit. You should now be connected.
